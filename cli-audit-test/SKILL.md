# Audit Test — Test Plan Quality & Maturity Scorer

Evaluate a test plan or test suite against ISTQB standards, TMMi maturity model, and industry best practices.

> "A test plan that only says 'we will test' without specifying *which techniques* and *why* is a major red flag."
> — ISTQB Foundation Level Syllabus v4.0

## Core Principle

**A test plan is a contract with quality.** Every dimension left vague is a risk accepted silently. This skill measures how explicitly and completely that contract is defined, using a 12-dimension framework calibrated on ISTQB, TMMi, and proven industry patterns.

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` is the target to audit:

- **Test plan document** (`.md`, `.txt`, `.adoc`, `.pdf`): audit the plan as written
- **Tests directory** (`tests/`, `tests/e2e/`, etc.): infer the plan from the test structure, files, and config
- **Empty**: search for test plans in the project root, then fall back to `tests/` directory analysis

### Input Discovery

1. Glob for test plan documents: `**/test-plan*`, `**/test-strategy*`, `**/TESTING*`
2. Glob for test directories: `**/tests/**`, `**/test/**`, `**/e2e/**`, `**/spec/**`
3. Glob for CI config: `.github/workflows/*`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `justfile`
4. Glob for test config: `**/pict/**`, `**/fixtures/**`, `**/mocks/**`, `**/toxiproxy*`
5. Read project manifest (Cargo.toml, package.json, etc.) for test dependencies

## 13-Dimension Framework

Score each dimension **0-4**, then compute a weighted final score. Read `references/dimensions.md` for detailed scoring criteria, evidence patterns, and per-dimension guidance.

| # | Dimension | Weight | Key question |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------|
| D1 | Scope & Objectives | 7% | Is what's tested (and what's not) explicit? |
| D2 | Test Design Techniques | 12% | Are recognized techniques (EP, BVA, pairwise...) used? |
| D3 | Pyramid Balance | 7% | Is the unit > integration > E2E ratio healthy? |
| D4 | Coverage & Traceability | 11% | Can you trace each requirement to a test? |
| D5 | Negative Testing & Security | 8% | Are error paths and security invariants tested? |
| D6 | Non-Functional Testing | 9% | Performance, security, accessibility, reliability? |
| D7 | Risk Analysis & Prioritization | 7% | Do critical features get more test effort? |
| D8 | Automation Strategy | 9% | What's automated vs manual, and why? |
| D9 | CI/CD Integration | 7% | Do tests run on commit with quality gates? |
| D10 | Entry/Exit Criteria | 5% | When is testing "done"? Measurable thresholds? |
| D11 | Exploratory Testing | 5% | Structured charters and time-boxed sessions? |
| D12 | Environment & Data | 5% | Automated setup, deterministic data, mocks? |
| D13 | Semantic Drift Detection | 8% | Are silent behavioral changes caught before merge? |

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Discover test assets

Glob for test files, CI configs, test frameworks. Build a test inventory: total files by type, directories and purpose, CI jobs, frameworks detected.

### Step 2 — Classify test files

For each test file/directory, classify by level (unit/integration/E2E/acceptance), technique, type (functional/security/performance), and polarity (positive/negative). Read `references/techniques.md` for technique detection heuristics.

### Step 3 — Score all 13 dimensions

For each dimension: collect evidence (file references, counts, patterns), assign score 0-4 with justification, note strengths and gaps. Read `references/dimensions.md` for detailed scoring criteria.

### Step 4 — Detect anti-patterns

Read `references/anti-patterns.md` for the 10 anti-patterns with detection rules and recommendations. Flag with severity and evidence.

### Step 5 — Compute final score

```
Final Score = Σ (dimension_score / 4 × weight × 100)
```

Normalize to 0-100 scale. Read `references/scoring-framework.md` for TMMi mapping and benchmarks.

### Step 6 — Generate report

Use the output format below.

## Output Format

```markdown
# Test Plan Quality Audit — {project-name}

**Date:** {date}
**Target:** {what was audited}
**Final Score:** {X}/100 — {verdict}
**TMMi Equivalent:** Level {N}

## Test Inventory

| Type | Count | Examples |
|------|-------|---------|
| Unit tests | N | `src/*/tests.rs` |
| Integration tests | N | `tests/integration/` |
| E2E tests | N | `tests/e2e/tests/` |
| Total | N | |

## Dimension Scores

| # | Dimension | Weight | Score | /4 | Weighted | Verdict |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|----|----------|---------|
| D1-D13 rows... |
| | **Total** | **100%** | | | **X.X** | |

### Techniques Detected

## Anti-Patterns Detected

## Strengths / Gaps & Recommendations / Maturity Assessment
```

### Quality Thresholds

| Range | Verdict |
|-------|---------|
| 86-100 | Excellent — Comprehensive, mature, CI-integrated |
| 71-85 | Good — Solid plan with minor gaps |
| 51-70 | Acceptable — Functional but needs improvement |
| 26-50 | Insufficient — Major gaps, significant risk |
| 0-25 | Critical — Plan needs complete rework |

## Rules for the Auditor

1. **Evidence-based**: Every score needs a file reference, count, or concrete observation.
2. **Proportional**: Scale judgment to project size. A 5-test project differs from a 118-test enterprise suite.
3. **Technique-aware**: Recognize techniques even when not explicitly named. `tests/budget/` with 79%, 80%, 100%, 101% values IS BVA.
4. **Structure over documentation**: A well-organized test directory IS a test plan. Judge by substance, not ceremony.
5. **Score honestly**: 100/100 means world-class. 70/100 is genuinely good. 50/100 is typical.
6. **Anti-patterns > missing features**: Detecting an ice cream cone is more valuable than noting a missing charter.
7. **Actionable output**: Every gap must come with a concrete, sized recommendation.
8. **Gotchas** — read `../../gotchas.md` before producing output to avoid known mistakes.

## Integration with other cli-* skills

| Skill | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| `cli-audit-code` | Scores code quality. cli-audit-test scores **test quality** |
| `cli-audit-doc` | Scores doc quality. cli-audit-test checks **test documentation** |
| `cli-audit-sync` | Verifies doc-code coherence. cli-audit-test verifies **test-requirement coherence** |
| `cli-forge-schema` | Can visualize test plan as diagrams (pyramid, state machines) |
| `cli-cycle` | Calls cli-audit-test as part of the full project review |

## What this skill does NOT do

- **Does not run tests** — it audits the plan/structure
- **Does not generate tests** — it identifies gaps
- **Does not replace manual review** — it provides a structured framework
- **Does not check test correctness** — it checks test *strategy*

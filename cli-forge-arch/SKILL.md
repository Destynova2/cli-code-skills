# Arch Router — HLD / LLD Dispatcher

This skill has been split into two focused skills. Route the user's request accordingly:

## Routing Table

| Signal in user's request | Delegate to |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| "HLD", "system design", "architecture", "C4 context/container", "capacity", "back-of-envelope", "ATAM", "Gate review", "design proposal" | **`/cli-forge-hld`** |
| "LLD", "detailed design", "class diagram", "sequence diagram", "API spec", "DB schema", "component design", "STRIDE", "threat model" | **`/cli-forge-lld`** |
| "design doc", "tech spec" (ambiguous) | Ask the user: "Do you want a **high-level design** (system architecture, C4 L1-L2, capacity estimation, ADRs) or a **low-level design** (class diagrams, API contracts, DB schemas, sequence diagrams)?" |
| Both mentioned | Produce HLD first, then LLD for each key container |

## What changed

The original `cli-forge-arch` combined HLD and LLD in a single skill. This caused issues:
- Users asking for HLD got LLD-level detail (class diagrams, DB schemas) they didn't need
- Users asking for LLD got HLD-level context (system diagrams, capacity) that was redundant
- The skill was too large to produce focused, high-quality output

**New skills:**
- **`cli-forge-hld`** — C4 L1-L2, capacity estimation, ADRs, ATAM tradeoff analysis, deployment architecture
- **`cli-forge-lld`** — C4 L3-L4, class/sequence/state diagrams, API contracts, DB schemas, STRIDE, testability

The `references/` directory is preserved here for backward compatibility but the canonical references now live in each skill's own `references/` directory.

> **Optimization:** This skill uses on-demand loading. Heavy content lives in `references/` and is loaded only when needed.

> **Language rule:** Detect the project's primary language (from README, comments, docs, commit messages). Output labels, titles, and annotations in that language. If the project is bilingual, ask the user which language to use before proceeding.

# Schema Forge — Clear Diagrams, Zero Syntax Errors

Generate professional, GitHub-compatible Mermaid diagrams that are **readable first, pretty second**.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Clarity over completeness** — a diagram that shows too much shows nothing. If it's complex, split it
2. **Right tool for the job** — pick the diagram type that makes the data obvious, not the one that looks fancy
3. **GitHub-first** — every diagram must render on GitHub without errors. No FontAwesome, no click events, no exotic features
4. **UX ergonomics** — treat diagrams like UI: if a user needs more than 5 seconds to understand the flow, redesign it
5. **Truth over aspiration** — a diagram must reflect what EXISTS in the code, not what someone hopes to build. Stale diagrams are worse than no diagrams
6. **Gotchas** — read `../../gotchas.md` before producing output to avoid known mistakes

---

## Operating Modes

This skill operates in three modes, detected from the user's input:

### Mode A — Single Diagram

The user describes something specific to visualize. Generate one diagram.

**Trigger:** text description, broken Mermaid, table to convert, specific request.

### Mode B — Doc Scan & Convert

The user points at a directory or says "scan", "audit docs", "make visual". The skill crawls documentation files and converts everything that would be **genuinely more readable** as Mermaid.

**Trigger:** path to a directory, "scan docs", "convert everything", "make docs visual".

### Mode C — Project Schema

The user wants a diagram of the **current project** (architecture, module structure, data flow). The skill reads the actual codebase to generate accurate diagrams.

**Trigger:** "project schema", "architecture of this project", "visualize this codebase", "show me the structure".

---

## Mode B — Doc Scan & Convert

Read `references/modes.md` for the full workflow: candidate detection table, conversion rules, and output format.

**Key rule:** Only convert if the diagram is **genuinely more readable** than the original.

---

## Mode C — Project Schema

Read `references/modes.md` for the full workflow: codebase analysis, diagram generation table, IMPLEMENTED vs PLANNED distinction, and accuracy checklist.

---

## Mode A — Single Diagram

### Step 1 — Understand the intent

What does the user want to visualize?

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Text description ("show me how X works") | Design the right diagram type from scratch |
| Existing Mermaid block (broken or ugly) | Fix syntax errors, improve readability |
| Markdown table | Convert to the most appropriate visual format |
| Code/architecture | Extract structure and visualize it |
| Kanban / PERT / timeline data | Convert to proper Mermaid format |
| "Simplify this diagram" | Reduce complexity, split if needed |

### Step 2 — Choose the right diagram type

Think like a UX designer. Match the **data shape** to the **diagram type**:

| Data shape | Best diagram | When to switch |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Process with steps | `flowchart` | > 15 nodes → split into sub-flows |
| Interactions between actors | `sequenceDiagram` | > 8 participants → group into sub-diagrams |
| Object/class structure | `classDiagram` | > 10 classes → split by domain/module |
| State transitions | `stateDiagram-v2` | > 12 states → use composite states or split |
| Data relationships | `erDiagram` | > 8 entities → split by bounded context |
| Project timeline | `gantt` | > 20 tasks → split by phase/milestone |
| Proportions/distribution | `pie` | > 7 slices → group small ones into "Other" |
| Hierarchy/brainstorm | `mindmap` | > 4 levels deep → flatten or split branches |
| Chronological events | `timeline` | > 15 events → split by era/phase |
| Flow volumes | `sankey` | Keep under 15 flows |
| Priority/comparison | `quadrantChart` | Always exactly 4 quadrants |
| Git workflow | `gitGraph` | Keep under 10 commits per branch shown |
| Requirements | `requirementDiagram` | > 10 requirements → split by category |

**Decision heuristic:** If you hesitate between two types, pick the one with fewer visual elements for the same information.

### Step 3 — Complexity check (the 5-second rule)

Before writing, estimate complexity:

```
nodes + edges = complexity score
```

| Score | Action |
|-------|--------|
| < 20 | Single diagram, go ahead |
| 20-40 | Consider grouping with subgraphs |
| 40-80 | Split into 2-3 diagrams with a navigation overview |
| > 80 | Mandatory split. Create an overview diagram + detail diagrams |

**Splitting strategy:**
1. Create a **Level 0 overview** (max 7 boxes, one per sub-diagram)
2. Each sub-diagram is self-contained with clear entry/exit points
3. Name sub-diagrams consistently: "Detail: [Topic]"
4. Reference between diagrams using consistent node names

### Step 4 — Write the diagram

Follow these rules strictly:

#### GitHub Compatibility (non-negotiable)

- Use ` ```mermaid ` fenced code blocks
- **NO** FontAwesome icons (`fa:fa-*`) — use emoji or text instead
- **NO** click events or callbacks
- **NO** tooltips or interactive features
- **NO** `%%{init: {"theme": "..."}}%%` with custom fonts (GitHub ignores them)
- Node IDs: start with a letter, use `camelCase` or `snake_case`
- Keep under **50 nodes** and **100 edges** per diagram (GitHub hard limits: 280 edges)
- Keep total Mermaid block under **2000 characters** for reliable rendering
- Test-worthy: the diagram must parse without errors

#### Readability Rules

1. **Direction matters:**
   - `TB` (top-bottom) for hierarchies and flows
   - `LR` (left-right) for timelines and sequences
   - `RL` for right-to-left language projects
2. **Labels are mandatory** — no unlabeled arrows. Every edge tells a story
3. **Node shapes convey meaning:**
   - `[text]` rectangle = process/action
   - `(text)` rounded = start/end
   - `{text}` diamond = decision
   - `[(text)]` cylinder = database/storage
   - `[[text]]` subroutine = external system
   - `>text]` flag = event/signal
4. **Subgraphs for grouping** — use them to reduce visual noise, not add it
5. **Max 3 levels of nesting** in subgraphs

#### Color & Styling (functional, not decorative)

Use `classDef` for semantic coloring. Never more than 5 classes per diagram.

```mermaid
classDef primary fill:#4A90D9,stroke:#2C6CB0,color:#fff
classDef success fill:#27AE60,stroke:#1E8449,color:#fff
classDef warning fill:#F39C12,stroke:#D68910,color:#fff
classDef danger fill:#E74C3C,stroke:#C0392B,color:#fff
classDef neutral fill:#ECF0F1,stroke:#BDC3C7,color:#2C3E50
```

**When to use color:**
- Highlight the happy path (green) vs error path (red)
- Distinguish system boundaries (colored subgraphs)
- Mark status: done/active/pending
- **Never** use color as the only differentiator — labels must stand alone

### Step 5 — Convert existing content

Read `references/conversions.md` for 15+ conversion patterns: table→diagram, kanban→flowchart, PERT→gantt, SQL→ER, JSON→class, API→sequence, RACI→flowchart, and more.

### Step 6 — Review checklist

Before delivering, verify:

- [ ] Renders on GitHub (no syntax errors)
- [ ] Passes the 5-second rule (intent is immediately clear)
- [ ] All edges are labeled (except trivial parent-child)
- [ ] Node count under 50 per diagram
- [ ] Colors are functional, not decorative (max 5 `classDef`)
- [ ] No GitHub-incompatible features (FA icons, click events, tooltips)
- [ ] Direction matches the data flow (TB for hierarchy, LR for timeline)
- [ ] Complex diagrams are split with an overview
- [ ] Labels match the project's language

## Diagram Type Quick Reference

Read `references/diagram-types.md` for detailed syntax and GitHub-tested examples of each diagram type.

## Anti-patterns

| Don't | Do instead |
|-------|-----------|
| 50+ nodes in one diagram | Split into overview + details |
| Rainbow colors | Max 5 semantic colors |
| Unlabeled edges | Every arrow tells what happens |
| `fa:fa-icon` in nodes | Use emoji or text labels |
| Deeply nested subgraphs (4+) | Flatten to 2-3 levels max |
| Diagram as decoration | Diagram as communication |
| Same diagram type for everything | Match type to data shape |
| Wall of text in nodes | Short labels, details in docs |

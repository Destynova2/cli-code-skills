# Forge LLD — Low-Level / Detailed Design

Translate an HLD's "what" into the "how" — detailed enough that a developer can implement without ambiguity. *(Robert C. Martin, Clean Architecture)*

## Core Principles

1. **Mitosis** — the document grows only the sections the component actually needs. A stateless function doesn't need a state machine. A read-only service doesn't need a migration plan. Kill empty sections, don't fill them with boilerplate
2. **Implementable precision** — every included section must be specific enough to code from. No hand-waving
3. **Contract-first** — define API contracts and interfaces before internals
4. **SOLID by default** — design visible in class diagrams must respect SOLID; flag violations explicitly
5. **Patterns justified** — only document a pattern when its use is non-obvious from reading the code
6. **KISS** — one clear diagram beats two pages of prose. One code example beats three paragraphs of explanation. Readers are developers — they scan for interfaces, schemas, and contracts
7. **Gotchas** — read `../../gotchas.md` before producing output to avoid known mistakes

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Identify scope

| Signal | Output |
|--------|--------|
| "LLD", "low-level design", "detailed design" | Full LLD for a component/service |
| "class diagram", "module design" | Class/module design section only |
| "API spec", "contract", "OpenAPI" | API contract section only |
| "DB schema", "database design", "ER diagram" | Database schema section only |
| "sequence diagram", "flow" | Sequence diagram for a specific flow |
| "STRIDE", "threat model" | Security design section only |
| "state machine", "lifecycle" | State machine section only |

### Step 2 — Locate the HLD anchor

The LLD must reference its parent HLD:
1. Check if an HLD exists in the project (`docs/*hld*`, `docs/*architecture*`, `docs/*design*`)
2. If yes: identify which HLD container(s) this LLD covers
3. If no: note that this LLD is standalone and may need an HLD later

### Step 3 — Gather implementation context

Read existing code if available:
- **Source files** for the component (understand current structure)
- **Cargo.toml / package.json** (dependencies, features)
- **Config files** (understand runtime configuration)
- **Existing tests** (understand testing approach)
- **CI pipeline** (understand deployment constraints)

### Step 4 — Size the document (Mitosis)

Determine the component's complexity tier. The tier decides which sections to include.

**Detect the tier from signals:**

| Signal | Tier |
|--------|------|
| Pure function, utility module, single-file component | **S** |
| Single service with DB, one domain concept | **M** |
| Service with external deps, multiple domain concepts, async flows | **L** |
| Complex service: multi-aggregate, saga, high concurrency, regulated | **XL** |

**Section inclusion matrix:**

| # | Section | S | M | L | XL |
|---|---------|---|---|---|-----|
| 1 | Overview & HLD Anchor | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| 2 | Component Architecture (C4 L3) | — | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| 3 | Tactical Domain Model | — | If DDD | Yes | Yes |
| 4 | Class/Module Design | Key interfaces | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| 5 | API Contracts | If API exists | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| 6 | Database Schema | If persistence | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| 7 | Sequence Diagrams | Main flow only | Happy + error | All critical | All |
| 8 | State Machines | — | If >2 states | Yes | Yes |
| 9 | Error Handling & Resilience | Error codes only | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| 10 | Concurrency Design | — | — | If shared state | Yes |
| 11 | Caching Strategy | — | If cache exists | Yes | Yes |
| 12 | Component-Level Security (STRIDE) | — | Input validation | Yes | Yes |
| 13 | Testability Design | — | DI points only | Yes | Yes |
| 14 | Configuration & Feature Flags | — | If non-trivial | Yes | Yes |
| 15 | Micro-ADRs | — | If non-obvious | Yes | Yes |
| 16 | Migration Plan | — | — | If brownfield | If brownfield |

**Target document size:**

| Tier | Pages | Sections | Diagrams |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| S | 1-3 | 3-5 | 1-2 |
| M | 4-8 | 7-10 | 3-5 |
| L | 8-15 | 12-14 | 5-8 |
| XL | 12-20 | All 16 | 8+ |

**Rules:**
- **Never include an empty section.** Omit entirely — don't write "N/A" or "Not applicable"
- **Merge small sections** for tier S. Class Design + API Contract + DB Schema can be one "Implementation" section
- **State the tier** at the top so readers calibrate their expectations
- **Diagram > prose.** If the class diagram already shows the relationships, don't re-explain them in text
- Ask: "Would a developer make a wrong implementation choice without this section?" If no, cut it

### Step 5 — Write the LLD

**Only include sections selected by the mitosis matrix in Step 4.** For tier S, merge related sections freely.

Read `references/sections.md` for full section templates with Mermaid examples. Only include sections selected by the mitosis matrix.

## HLD vs LLD Boundary

| In LLD | NOT in LLD (→ HLD) |
|--------|---------------------|
| C4 Level 3-4 diagrams | C4 Level 1-2 diagrams |
| Full API contracts (OpenAPI) | API surface list |
| Table schemas with indexes | Entity-relationship sketch |
| Class diagrams with methods, SOLID | Container diagram |
| Circuit breaker config values | "We use circuit breakers" |
| Component-level STRIDE (SQLi, IDOR, input validation) | System-level trust boundaries, security policies |
| Retry/backoff configuration | Failure mode categories |
| Migration scripts / phases | "We'll migrate data" |
| Tactical DDD (aggregates, entities, value objects) | Strategic DDD (bounded contexts, context maps) |
| Concurrency design (locks, channels, race conditions) | Scalability strategy (horizontal, sharding) |
| Testability design (DI points, mock boundaries) | Test strategy overview |
| Cache TTLs, invalidation patterns | "We need caching for hot data" |

If you're drawing system context or estimating capacity, you've drifted into HLD territory. Stop and suggest the user invoke `/cli-forge-hld`.

## Review Checklist

**All tiers:** Tier stated | HLD referenced | Interfaces defined | Mermaid syntax | No empty sections | No HLD-level content

**M+:** C4 L3 | API contracts (schemas + errors) | DB schema (ER + indexes) | Sequence diagrams (happy + error) | Error taxonomy

**L+:** Class diagram (SOLID) | State machines | STRIDE | Testability (DI + mocks) | Micro-ADRs

**XL:** Concurrency | Tactical DDD | Migration plan (if brownfield)

**Size:** S: 1-3p | M: 4-8p | L: 8-15p | XL: 12-20p — no section exists just because it's in the template
